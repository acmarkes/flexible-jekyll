Hi! I'm a brazilian mathematics undergraduate with self-taught data science skills who is now pursuing a Data Scientist degree at the Pontíficia Universidade Católica in Rio de Janeiro.
This corner of the internet is my humble portfolio where I hope I can show you interesting things with the help of data. Feel free to contact me through any of the channels available on the sidebar 
if you want to talk data or hire me :).
