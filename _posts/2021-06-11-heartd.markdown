This project includes the creation of a predictive model for heart disease diagnostics and its deployment as a web app using the [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/) python library.

You can use the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/acmarkes/heart-disease-webapp/main/heartd-app.py).

The data used for the training of the model can be found on the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). Given the small amount of data and my lack of expertise in healthcare, the results given by the model should in no way serve as substitute for the diagnosis made by an actual medical professional.

The data analysis and cleaning was superficial because the objective was the quick deployment of a simple predictive model. With that said, the project includes preprocessing of the dataset, feature selection and model and hyperparameter testing. After the model was completed, I used Streamlit as an alternative to Flask and Django for people who don't have a lot of experience with web development, like me, but want fast and easy deployment of models and visualizations. 

The code can be found on [my repo](https://github.com/acmarkes/heart-disease-webapp).
