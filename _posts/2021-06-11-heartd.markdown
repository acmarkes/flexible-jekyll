Demonstration of the Streamlit library for deployment of machine learning predictive models.

You can use the app [here](https://share.streamlit.io/acmarkes/heart-disease-webapp/main/heartd-app.py).

The data used for the training of the model can be found on the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). Given the small amount of data and my lack of expertise in healthcare, the results given by the model should in no way serve as substitute for the diagnosis made by an actual medical professional.

The code can be found on [my repo](https://github.com/acmarkes/heart-disease-webapp). The cleaning and training process can be found on the heartd-model.py file. Data analysis and cleaning was superficial because the objective was the quick deployment of a simple predictive model. The code for the web app can be found on the heartd-app.py
